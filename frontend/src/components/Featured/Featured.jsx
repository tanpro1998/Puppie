          <h1>Updated Records</h1>
          <p>
            Our dogs for sale have their own records of ancestry details,
            individual information, and clear dog photos. New owners want to
            have the photos of their dogs since they were puppies. Our breeder
            is caring and supportive enough to provide enough details about the
            puppies’ training and experiences. This is to make the puppies’
            transfer from the breeder to the new owner’s home as smooth and easy
            as possible. It is their aim to lessen the problems that adjustment
            may bring about. Our puppies have limited registrations from the
            country of their origin and with the kennel club of Singapore. New
            owners receive a copy of this registration when they bring home the
            puppy.

            necessary heath clearances. Our puppies have been watched and
            monitored since they were conceived. The parents were of excellent
            health and were treated with utmost care. Every puppy was assured of
            going through the first 24 hours in good condition. You can be
            assured that our dogs came from responsible breeders. Our puppies

            puppies and dogs. They are given more training as they grow up. Our

            and people in their surroundings. Their emotional problems are less
            than other pups. Their social training has been done in the kennel

          <h1>The Price</h1>
          <p>
            Cheap dogs become more expensive in the long run. It may not have
            been well-trained. As such, your expenses will multiply as you have
            to care for the dog for about 10 years. Unless you dispose of him
            early or the dog decides to quit on you, he would be a source of
            problems. Well-bred puppies are not cheap, but they will bring you
            joy instead of disgust.
